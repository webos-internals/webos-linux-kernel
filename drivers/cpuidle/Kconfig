	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using a mobile platform that supports CPU idle PM (e.g.
	  an ACPI-capable notebook), you should say Y here.
